  Kek batik is a Malaysian refrigerator cake delicacy influenced by tiffin, which was brought in by the British during the colonial era and altered with Malaysian ingredients. Broken Marie biscuits are combined with a chocolate sauce or a runny custard made with egg, butter/margarine, condensed milk, Milo, and chocolate powders to make this cake. The cake is served on exceptional occasions such as Eid al-Fitr or birthday celebrations.
